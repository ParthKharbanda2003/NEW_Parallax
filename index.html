                <h3 class="desc">BIKING</h3>
            </diV>
            <p class="text">Cycling (also known as bicycling or biking) is the riding of bicycles (also cycles, or bikes) for leisure or as part of competition. In many countries, the cycle is also an important mode of transport, more so in Asia (especially in Southeast Asia) and Africa. In Europe, cycling is predominantly a recreational activity. The continent is very much the hub of cycling as a competitive sport, but modern Europeans are increasingly inclined to use the bike as a favoured mode of transport (from home to office – and back). Indeed, across the world today, the cycle is the preferred means of conveyance for many commuters. Compared to the ubiquitous motorcar, cycles contribute almost nothing to air or noise pollution, besides giving the rider plenty of opportunity to get in some exercise. In cities, bikes help lessen traffic congestion and assist in solving seemingly perennial parking problems, as well as offering easier manoeuvrability. The bike, then, has plenty of things going for it – it’s kinder to the environment; it costs little to buy, operate and maintain; it is incredibly convenient to own; and it is the ideal way to fitness. All of these factors contribute towards making cycling a fun and enjoyable activity.
                There are three types of cycling: Utility, recreational (touring, organized rides, mountain) and racing.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="text">This sport requires endurance, core and back strength, balance, bike handling skills, and self-reliance. Advanced riders pursue both steep technical descents and high-incline climbs. In the case of freeride, downhill, and dirt jumping, aerial maneuvers are performed off both natural features and specially constructed jumps and ramps</p>

            <h3 class="desc">PARAGLIDING</h3>
            </diV>
            <p class="text">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or lies prone in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="text">Paragliding is a type of extreme sport found in the early 1980s by people interested in aerial sports, and it allows one to run off the slopes with free parachutes. Paragliding is generally more accessible than other extreme sports since it does not require a special take off or a landing track. Paragliding is also the fastest developed air sport in the world.</p>

                <h3 class="desc">SURFING</h3>
            </diV>
            <p class="text">Surfing is a sea sport made by riding on the waves with the help of a longboard.Today, surfing is one of the most popular and most preferred extreme sports in the world. It is done by riding the waves in the sea or the ocean by standing or lying on a surfboard.  This extreme sport, which is thought to have originated in the Southern Hemisphere in ancient times, was a necessity rather than entertainment or a hobby. Used as a way to return to the shore from the ships originally, surfing became a hobby with time and an official sport in 1920.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="text">If you want to surf, you will require some balance and durability. You should not lose your balance while standing on the surfboard and on the water. Before trying this sport, you should do some basic training that will improve your balance and endurance. You can prepare yourself for this extreme sport by going to surfing courses. When surfing, all you need is a surfboard. When you find the harmony between the sea and the wind, you can easily enjoy surfing.</p>
